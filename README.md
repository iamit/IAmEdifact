IAmEdifact
==========

A wrapper to send and receive edifact messages

I started a site for documentation of this project, see: [Initial documentation](https://sites.google.com/site/edifact4java/home)

In the end above documentation will be put here, and growing...

It all started with my question on stackoverflow: [Question about java and edifact on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4154898/create-a-javax-mail-message-of-mimetype-application-edifact)

Normally getting a quick response... I was a bit surprised, after a few weeks still no answers...

Warning: 
1) The initial code is actually not quit ready yet for publishing, however, since not another very clear code to be found... this is better than nothing.

2) I will work on cleaning the code, improving it, and get the demo working properly.

3) For now also a lot of things are hardcoded, to get it working for my purpose....

My first feedback on sending the code to a developer in Sweden is, that it was very helpfull to him.

So I guess: see if you can use it, and whether there is somebody wanna improve things in the code, to get it working for even more people. Any feedback is welcome.
